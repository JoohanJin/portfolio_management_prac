Even though cash is a \"safe asset\" in the sense that the asset value does not go down, cash can be very risky asset because the value of the liabilities goes up when interest rates go down. Therefore, if we thinkg about the savings in terms of funding ratio, how much money do we have compared to what we need, then cash is a risky asset and can result in a decline in the funding ratio."
