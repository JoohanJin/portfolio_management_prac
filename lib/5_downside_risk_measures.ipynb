    "### Downside Risk Measures\n",
    "- Reminded that asset returns were not normally distributed. In this context, the real concern for conducting investment is the probability of the large loss, the probability of the large negative return on the portfolios that they are holding.\n",
    "- Average or Standard Deviation around the mean, that is exactly what volatility means.\n",
    "- need to look at more **extreme deviation** around the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Volatility versus Semi-Deviation\n",
    "- Semi-deviation is **the volatiity of the sub-sample of Below-Average** OR **below-zero returns**.\n",
    "- Volatility or Uncertainty does not bother investors when they are upside. What really bothers invesotrs is when there's uncertainty or volatility on the downside. Therefore, we just *truncate* the return.\n",
    "    - simple to compute as a risk measure. \n",
    "        $$ \\sigma_{semi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{R_t \\leq \\bar{R}}(R_t-\\bar{R})^2} $$\n",
    "        - Where $N$ is the *Number of Returns* that fall below the Mean.\n",
    "        - It is the *Semi-Deviation* since it is the deviation from the mean, but we only look at the deviation, when the value is the less than the mean.\n",
    "    - Gain does not talk anything about the extreme losses that can happen when we are below the mean."
